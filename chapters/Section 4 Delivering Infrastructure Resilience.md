# Section 4: Delivering Infrastructure Resilience

## Purpose of this Section
This section focuses on how infrastructure resilience is delivered in practice across the full lifecycle of infrastructure systems. It covers planning, retrofit, operations, and end-of-life considerations, emphasizing principles that enable continuous learning, adaptation, and responsible transition.

## Key Takeaways
- Resilience must be embedded across the entire infrastructure lifecycle
- Planning, operations, and retirement decisions are interconnected
- Learning, adaptation, and social alignment are critical to effective resilience
- Digital tools support but do not replace good governance and design principles
