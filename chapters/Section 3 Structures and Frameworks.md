# Section 3: Structures and Frameworks

## Purpose of this Section
This section presents the institutional, financial, regulatory, and data governance structures that enable infrastructure resilience. It focuses on how resilience is framed, funded, governed, and operationalised across organisations, sectors, and jurisdictions.

## Key Takeaways
- Infrastructure resilience must be embedded in business and funding structures
- Governance and regulation shape incentives and accountability
- Data interoperability and sharing are foundational to coordinated resilience
- Organisational enablers determine the effectiveness of resilience strategies
