# Section 2: A Complexity Science Lens on Infrastructure Resilience

## Purpose of this Section
This section introduces complexity science as a lens for understanding infrastructure resilience. It focuses on relations, interdependencies, system dynamics, failure mechanisms, and the evolution of representational and digital methods that shape how infrastructure systems are understood, managed, and transformed.

## Key Takeaways
- Infrastructure systems are relational, dynamic, and interdependent
- Complexity leads to emergent behavior and non-linear failure modes
- Information and representation fundamentally shape system outcomes
- Digitalisation disrupts existing equilibria and enables new forms of resilience
