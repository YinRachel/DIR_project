# Section 1: Baselines and Definitions

## Purpose of this Section
This section establishes the foundational concepts, terminology, and baseline structures used throughout the book. It provides a common language for discussing infrastructure resilience, hazards, digitalisation, and risk across sectors and disciplines.

## Key Takeaways
- Infrastructure resilience relies on clear definitions of systems, services, and impacts
- Hazards, threats, and vulnerabilities evolve over time and space
- Digitalisation underpins modern resilience but introduces new dependencies
- Risk and resilience are related but distinct concepts with different responsibilities
