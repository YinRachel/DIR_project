# Section 5: Digitalisation

## Purpose of this Section
This section examines digital technologies that enable infrastructure resilience, focusing on data collection, communication, intelligence, and information protection. It highlights how digitalisation supports monitoring, decision-making, and adaptation while introducing new dependencies and risks.

## Key Takeaways
- Digitalisation extends situational awareness and decision capability
- Distributed intelligence improves resilience under communication constraints
- Emerging technologies offer new opportunities and new risks
- Information protection is foundational to trust and system integrity
