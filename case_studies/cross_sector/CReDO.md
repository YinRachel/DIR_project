# Case Study: Climate Resilience Demonstrator (CReDo) – Connected Digital Twins
https://cp.catapult.org.uk/case-study/unlocking-climate-resilience-through-connected-digital-twins/


## Description and Basic Information
The Climate Resilience Demonstrator (CReDo) is a UK-based, government-supported initiative led by Connected Places Catapult, developed between 2021 and 2023. The project brought together infrastructure owners and operators across multiple sectors—including energy, water, transport, and digital infrastructure—to create a connected digital twin environment focused on climate resilience.

CReDo was delivered as part of the UK’s National Digital Twin Programme, with the objective of demonstrating how connected digital twins can support cross-sector decision-making, particularly under climate-related risks such as flooding and extreme weather.

## Context
Critical national infrastructure systems are increasingly interdependent, yet they are often planned, operated, and regulated in silos. Climate hazards, especially flooding, expose these interdependencies, where the failure of one sector can cascade into others.

CReDo was designed to address this challenge by enabling infrastructure stakeholders to share data, models, and insights through a connected digital twin framework, allowing system-of-systems analysis rather than isolated sectoral assessment.

## Disruption or Risk Context
The primary risk context addressed by CReDo includes:
- Increased frequency and severity of climate-related hazards, particularly flooding
- Cascading failures across interdependent infrastructure systems
- Limited visibility of cross-sector impacts during extreme events
- Fragmented data ownership and lack of shared situational awareness

Traditional resilience planning approaches struggle to capture these interconnected risks, leading to sub-optimal or delayed responses.

## Digitalisation Approach
CReDo applied digitalisation through:
- Development of connected digital twins representing multiple infrastructure sectors
- Integration of heterogeneous datasets, including asset data, environmental data, and operational information
- Use of common information management frameworks to enable interoperability
- Scenario modelling and simulation to assess climate impacts and cascading effects

Rather than creating a single monolithic model, CReDo federated existing models and data sources, enabling collaboration while respecting organisational data boundaries.

## Resilience Outcomes
The CReDo project demonstrated several resilience benefits:
- Improved understanding of cross-sector interdependencies under climate stress
- Enhanced ability to simulate and assess cascading impacts of flooding
- Better coordination between infrastructure owners and operators
- Support for more informed planning, investment, and adaptation decisions

These outcomes contribute to anticipatory and adaptive resilience by enabling stakeholders to identify vulnerabilities and test mitigation strategies before real-world disruptions occur.

## Limitations and Trade-offs
Key limitations and trade-offs identified include:
- High coordination effort required across multiple organisations
- Challenges related to data sharing, governance, and trust
- Variability in data quality and model maturity across sectors
- Resource and capability requirements to develop and maintain digital twins

The project highlighted that digital twin technologies alone are insufficient without appropriate governance, standards, and institutional alignment.

## Key Lessons for Infrastructure Resilience
- Climate resilience requires system-of-systems thinking across infrastructure sectors
- Connected digital twins can reveal cascading risks that are otherwise hidden
- Interoperability and information management are as important as modelling fidelity
- Collaborative governance is essential for effective digital resilience solutions
- Digitalisation supports proactive adaptation rather than reactive response
