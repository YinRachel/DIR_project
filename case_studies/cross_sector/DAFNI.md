# Case Study: Data and Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure (DAFNI)
https://www.dafni.ac.uk/who-we-are/getting-started-on-dafni/
## Description and Basic Information
The Data and Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure (DAFNI) is a UK national research infrastructure platform established in 2019 and led by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), in collaboration with UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). DAFNI was created to support data-driven modelling, simulation, and analysis of the UK’s national infrastructure systems.

DAFNI provides a secure, cloud-based environment that integrates large-scale datasets, computational models, and high-performance computing resources to enable cross-sector infrastructure analysis spanning energy, transport, water, digital communications, and environmental systems.

## Context
National infrastructure systems are increasingly complex, interdependent, and exposed to multiple hazards, including climate change, cyber threats, and demographic pressures. Traditional infrastructure planning and analysis are often conducted within sectoral silos, limiting the ability to assess systemic risks and cascading impacts.

DAFNI was developed to address this gap by providing a shared digital platform where researchers, policymakers, and infrastructure stakeholders can analyse infrastructure as a system-of-systems, supporting long-term resilience planning and evidence-based decision-making.

## Disruption or Risk Context
The risk context addressed by DAFNI includes:
- Cascading failures across interdependent infrastructure sectors
- Climate-related risks such as flooding, heatwaves, and drought
- Infrastructure stress due to population growth and urbanisation
- Limited visibility of cross-sector vulnerabilities and trade-offs

Without integrated analysis tools, these risks are difficult to quantify and manage, leading to fragmented or suboptimal resilience strategies.

## Digitalisation Approach
DAFNI enables digitalisation through:
- A federated digital platform integrating heterogeneous infrastructure datasets
- A model library supporting simulation of infrastructure networks and interactions
- High-performance computing for large-scale scenario analysis
- Standardised data ingestion and workflow orchestration
- Secure access controls to support collaboration while protecting sensitive data

Rather than producing a single digital twin, DAFNI functions as an enabling environment that allows multiple models and datasets to interoperate within a common analytical framework.

## Resilience Outcomes
DAFNI has delivered resilience-related benefits by:
- Enabling system-level analysis of infrastructure interdependencies
- Supporting scenario-based assessment of extreme events and policy interventions
- Facilitating cross-sector collaboration between researchers and practitioners
- Improving the evidence base for infrastructure investment and adaptation planning

These capabilities strengthen anticipatory and adaptive resilience by allowing risks and interventions to be explored before real-world disruptions occur.

## Limitations and Trade-offs
Key limitations and trade-offs include:
- High technical and organisational barriers to entry for non-expert users
- Dependence on data availability and model quality
- Challenges in translating research outputs into operational decisions
- Resource requirements for maintaining and updating models and datasets

DAFNI demonstrates that digital platforms for resilience require sustained investment, skills development, and governance to deliver long-term value.

## Key Lessons for Infrastructure Resilience
- System-of-systems analysis is essential for managing national infrastructure risk
- Shared digital platforms can break down sectoral silos
- Digitalisation enables exploration of future scenarios rather than prediction alone
- Governance, standards, and user capability are critical success factors
- Research platforms play a vital role in informing resilient policy and planning
