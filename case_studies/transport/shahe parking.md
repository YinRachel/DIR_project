# Case Study: Digitalised Non-Motorised Vehicle Management at Shahe Metro Station, Beijing

## Description and Basic Information
This case study concerns the digitalised governance of non-motorised vehicle (primarily bicycles and e-bikes) parking around **Shahe Metro Station** in Beijing, China. The initiative has been developed and implemented by local district authorities with support from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission, and has been reported publicly between **2024 and 2026**.

Shahe Metro Station is a major transport node serving suburban–urban commuters. Daily passenger volumes approach **100,000 trips**, while surrounding areas generate demand for **tens of thousands of non-motorised vehicles** used for first- and last-mile connections. The project forms part of Beijing’s broader “精细化治理” (fine-grained urban governance) and “疏整促” (decongestion, rectification, and improvement) programmes.

## Context
As a high-intensity intermodal transport hub, Shahe Metro Station experienced chronic congestion caused by unmanaged bicycle and e-bike parking. Informal parking practices occupied pavements, fire access routes, and roadways, reducing pedestrian safety, slowing emergency response, and degrading overall transport efficiency.

The challenge was not a lack of demand, but a mismatch between **spatial supply**, **user behaviour**, and **management capacity**. Traditional enforcement-based approaches (blanket bans or forced clearance) were considered socially disruptive and unsustainable.

## Disruption or Risk Context
The primary risks addressed by this initiative include:
- Persistent congestion and disorder during peak commuting periods
- Reduced accessibility and safety for pedestrians and emergency services
- Inefficient first-/last-mile connectivity undermining public transport usage
- Governance overload from manual enforcement and repeated violations

While not an acute disaster scenario, these conditions represent a form of **chronic transport system stress**, which can reduce system reliability and amplify impacts during emergencies or extreme events.

## Digitalisation Approach
The project combines **physical infrastructure upgrades** with **digital management systems**, including:
- Construction of a **multi-storey non-motorised vehicle parking facility** (“非机动车停车楼”) with approximately **8,000 parking spaces**
- Design of segregated flows for pedestrians, motor vehicles, and non-motorised vehicles
- Deployment of a **city-wide non-motorised vehicle management app**, integrating:
  - Vehicle identification and entry/exit records
  - User credit and behaviour tracking
  - AI-enabled video analytics for parking compliance
  - Real-time monitoring, alerts, and enforcement support
- Use of digital dashboards and sensing to support adaptive, peak-aware operations
- Integration with public communication channels to guide user behaviour

The approach emphasises **“parking as data”**, enabling continuous monitoring, feedback, and behavioural nudging rather than static rule enforcement.

## Resilience Outcomes
The digitalised management of non-motorised transport has delivered several resilience-relevant outcomes:
- Improved reliability and efficiency of metro access during peak periods
- Reduced congestion and safer circulation around the station
- Enhanced capacity to adapt operations dynamically based on demand
- Lower enforcement burden through data-supported governance
- Increased user acceptance through convenience, incentives, and transparency

These outcomes strengthen the **absorptive and adaptive capacities** of the urban transport system under daily stress conditions and improve preparedness for disruption scenarios.

## Limitations and Trade-offs
Key limitations and trade-offs include:
- Dependence on digital platforms, sensing infrastructure, and electricity supply
- Privacy and data governance concerns related to user tracking and credit systems
- Capital investment requirements for parking structures and digital systems
- Potential exclusion of users without access to smartphones or digital services

The case illustrates the need to balance efficiency gains with inclusivity, privacy protection, and long-term operational sustainability.

## Key Lessons for Infrastructure Resilience
- Chronic congestion can be treated as a resilience problem, not only an efficiency issue
- Digitalisation enables fine-grained, adaptive governance of transport systems
- Combining physical redesign with digital management is more effective than either alone
- Behavioural incentives and feedback can outperform purely punitive approaches
- Transport resilience includes first- and last-mile systems, not only core networks
