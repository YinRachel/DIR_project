# Digitalisation for Infrastructure Resilience

This repository hosts a **living, book-style knowledge base** on **digitalisation for infrastructure resilience**.  
It brings together **conceptual frameworks, real-world case studies, datasets, benchmarks, and algorithms** across multiple infrastructure sectors.

The repository is designed to support:
- Researchers and PhD students
- Infrastructure operators and policymakers
- Practitioners working on resilience, risk, and digital transformation

---

## Scope

The content focuses on how **digital technologies** (data, models, platforms, AI) can enhance the **resilience of critical infrastructure systems** under:

- Chronic stress (congestion, ageing assets, climate pressure)
- Acute disruptions (extreme weather, cyberattacks, cascading failures)
- Long-term uncertainty and system transformation

### Infrastructure sectors covered
- Water
- Power
- Transport
- Telecommunications
- Cross-sector and interdependent systems
